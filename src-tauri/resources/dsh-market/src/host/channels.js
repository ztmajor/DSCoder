 * be handed every other author's unreleased work.
 *
 * The model lives in its own module because it is the part with rules
 * rather than plumbing: three channels, one of them hidden, a mapping to
 * npm dist-tags, and a resolution order that has already been got wrong
 * once (see `resolveChannel`).

 * it bought: a stored mode, a route to change it, a rule for what happens to
 * a dev choice when it is turned off, and a control whose own purpose needed

 * "stable" costs updates rather than just clarity — on the stable channel
 * `latest` (1.13.1) is not newer than an installed 1.14.0-beta.1, so the
 * market answers "up to date" and the next beta is never offered.
 *
 * Which makes `undefined` load-bearing: it has to survive both the settings
 * schema (no `.default`) and state.json (field omitted) or "never chose"
 * silently becomes "chose stable".
