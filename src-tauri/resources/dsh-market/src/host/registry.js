 * published this morning reads as "does not exist". So there is one source
 * now, and a failure is a failure — the caller reports it and offers a
 * retry, which is a state the user can act on. In particular a network
 * failure is NEVER answered from `served`: an origin that cannot be reached
 * has not confirmed anything, and quietly handing back the last catalog
