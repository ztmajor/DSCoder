/**
 * The process supervisor running this host, when one can be identified —
 * `null` when nothing says so.
 *
 * This exists because the failure it prevents is the worst one the market
 * can cause. Under systemd's default `KillMode=control-group`, everything in
 * the unit's cgroup dies with the main process — including the detached
 * helper that was supposed to bring the replacement up. So "restart" killed
 * a production service and nothing came back (#229 by @SkillBase-Al: "杀死了
 * 服务但是无法重复启动服务"). `allowRestart: false` was always the documented
 * answer, but it is opt-in, and nothing told the operator to opt in until
 * after they had already lost the service.
 *
 * TWO signals are required, and the second is the whole reason this function
 * is not a one-line env check. `INVOCATION_ID` is INHERITED: every
 * descendant of a systemd unit carries it, which on Linux includes an
 * ordinary desktop terminal (its shell descends from a user-session unit)
 * and a CI runner (the agent is a unit — this repo's own smoke test caught
 * that). Treating inheritance as ownership would disable the button for a
 * large population of hosts where it works fine, which is a worse bug than
 * the one being fixed.
 *
 * `ppid === 1` is what distinguishes being the unit's own main process from
 * merely descending from one: systemd forks its services from PID 1, while a
 * terminal's node has the shell as its parent and a runner's has the agent.
 *
 * Scoped to systemd on purpose. pm2 sets `pm_id`, but it is inherited the
 * same way and pm2's God daemon — not PID 1 — is the parent, so there is no
 * equivalent second signal; a guess there would reintroduce exactly the
 * false positive this pair exists to avoid. launchd has no marker at all.
 * Both still need the explicit setting: detection is a safety net over the
 * documented option, never a replacement for it.

 * What it fixes (#177, reported on Windows 11, reproducible every time): the

 * the listening socket had not been released yet, so the replacement died
 * instantly with EADDRINUSE — and the spawn was wrapped in `catch {}`, so
 * nothing was written anywhere. The user saw a restart button that did
 * nothing. The docstring above it even claimed the helper "waits for our
 * port to free up"; it never did.
 *
 * So: wait for the port to actually go quiet, then start, then CHECK that
 * something came up, and write a diagnosis when it did not. A restart that
 * fails must leave evidence — this one is invisible by construction, since
 * the process that would have logged it is the one that just exited.
 * @param port - the port the replacement must bind; when unknown, the helper
